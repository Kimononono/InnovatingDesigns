                <h2 style="font-size: 20px; padding: 30px;">Tim Urban: Inside the mind of a master procrastinator | TED</h2>
                <p> In Tim Urbans talk he discusses his thoughts on procrastination. Through a retelling of his worst procrastination moments, he reaches the conclusion that everyone iss a procrastinator to some extent. In his retelling he makes use of a instant gratification monkey and a rational decision maker to represent our brains decision process. He believes that while every procrastinator knows what he is doing, he is unable to act on his knowledge because he is not lead by rationality but instant gratitude. At the end he reminds us that the worst procrastination happens for the things that can't have a due date: life goals. And how procrastination can ultimately be a destructive habit despite the perception it takes on in our society. </p>

                <h2 style="font-size: 20px; padding: 30px;">The happy secret to better work | Shawn Achor</h2>
                <p>In Shawn Anchors talk he discusses the affects of positive psychology. He begins by talking about the cult of average that is perpetuated by holding people to the average statistics goals; how outliers and people who escape the average are minimized to further the cult of average. He believes that the cult of average shapes peoples reality. By limiting it to 'average', people withhold their potential. If people can change how they perceive reality, they are able to mold it to their liking. He goes in depth about how happiness is created: citing that 90% of our happiness is caused by internal actions. By simply being happier it molds reality into the successful life people strive for; rather than the myth that success creates happiness. Therefor, happiness will be transposed onto everything you do.</p>
